          </p>
          <h2>How does MINDDFULLL work?</h2>
          <p>
            All of the ingredients in MINDDFULLL are selected by our team of researchers based on medical and scientific insights. We take the time to understand the best ways to increase performance using the most powerful tool of all, the human brain.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Is MINDDFULLL safe?
          </h2>
          <p>
            MINDDFULLL is formulated from ONLY all-natural ingredients. So, it doesnt contain any heavy pharmaceutical ingredients. Many ingredients found in MINDDFULLL are available individually through premium suppliers who put them through rigerous quality testing before it's allowed for use in MINDDFULLL. MINDDFULLL has been shown to be safe for healthy adults over the age of 18.

          </p>
          <h2>
            What ingredients does MINDDFULLL contain?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Bacopa Monnieri, Vitamin B6, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine, Toothed Club Moss, Cat's Claw, L-Leucine
          </p>
          <h2>
            How fast does it work?
          </h2>
          <p>
            MINDDFULLL's rapid acting forumla works fast. You may start feeling the effects of MINDDFULLL as early as 30 minutes after taking it. Other factors include diet, sleep habits and other physical attributes. While some people may feel immediately, it takes time for others. We recommend trying MINDDFULLL for at least one month. If no benefits are experienced in this time, contact our cusotmer support for a refund.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Is MINDDFULL worth it?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Customers have told us that MINDDFULLL was the best return on investment they've ever spent. It's a fraction of the cost of a cup of coffee with more overall benefits. Buying each ingredient individually and having to take multiple supplements would cost a lot more with twice the amount of time and effort.
          </p>
          <h2>
            How much is shipping and when will I get it?
          </h2>
          <p>
            That will vary on where it's going and what carrier speed is selected but there are options available. We have a standard 2-4 business day processing period once the order is placed. Shipping cost can vary per location. The best way to find shipping prices is to go through the checkout process. Upon checkout, enter your shippiong info, and shipping carriers & prices should generate for your location.
          </p>

          <p>
            If MINDDFULLL doesnt work for you, just let us know for a full refund! We just ask that you tell us about your experience and what we could improve.
